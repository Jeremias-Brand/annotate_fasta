# annotate_fasta

Given a fasta file and the corresponding blast output this script annotates the fasta with the hit resulting in the longest alignment and covering the beginning of the query.

This is built with python3 and biopython.

Currently it is quite simplistic but the script could be extended to allow for more complex annotation.
